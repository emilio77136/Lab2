In short, the meaning of authorization is the process of giving the ability
to access a resource. You can look at authorization as an addition to 
authentication. First authentication veifies whether you are the person it's 
looking for, after it has found that person, it determines what you can do do
based on the roles that were assigned to that person. Authorization mechanisms
include role-based access control(RBAC), access control lists(ACLs), and the
principle of least privilege. Role based access control involves setting 
permissions to different roles. Some individuals may hve more or less 
permissions than others. Access control lists are more object-centered unlike
RBAC that is role-centered. Each object has its own list that specifies which
users can do what. The principle of least privilege gives users the minumum 
amount of permissions to reduce security risks. Many systems use a mix of both
RBAC and ACLs making it easier for large group of users while still allowing
access to sensitive resources.
